# Gentoo Overlay

## dev-db/olegdb

Good ol' olegdb.

## dev-util/relay

This ebuild installs the Puppet Relay CLI utility for https://relay.sh.

## media-sound/playerctl

This ebuild is copied from the core gentoo ebuild to update playerctl to a
version that supports `--player=playerctld`. This has become painful to not
have, especially after firefox added support for MPRIS.
